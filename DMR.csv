Unit deemed scrap for investigation purposes by customer request to inspect and teardown.

Investigation Log
SSW has documented the unit’s returned condition. Visual inspection for damage, discoloration/other appearance issues on file. 
The unit was delivered to Aero-Hose for investigation at their facility. 
The process for the evaluation described as follows;
- Remove the molded fire sleeve and chafe sleeve from the end fitting closest to the leak site to approximately 6 inches past the leak sire of the assembly.
- Perform a pressure test to try and determine the exact location of the leak.
-Once leak area is identified, remove that section of the assembly and perform an inspection to attempt to determine the cause.
(Completed 2/15/2021)

Investigation Coclusion
The uncovered unit damage was unlikely to be caused by the manufacturing processes. The surface damage on the casing and heat shrink  has potentially been inflicted during unit installation and/or operation. The assembly was able to withstand two 6,000 PSI hydrostatic pressure tests without leakage. Internal PTFE damage was not significant to cause leakage during the tests, but possibly propagated due to installation damage and operational stresses. The combination of internal and external damage of the assembly, as displayed on the reference images has been a cause of part failure.",1,1,0,,AERO:Finished Assy,OTH: Other
